          Dubai Fountain is the world's largest choreographed water fountain
          located in the beautiful Burj Complex. This dancing fountain surges as
          high as 150 meters in complete synchronisation to classical, Arabic
          and other popular world musical numbers. Forming beautiful arcs and
          jumping to the beats, this fountain was designed by California-based
          WET, the creators of the Fountains of Bellagio in Las Vegas. The show
          begins in the evening every day, and the best way to approach it is
          through the Dubai Mall.
